          This declaration creates a constant whose scope can be either global
          or local to the block in which it is declared. Global constants do not
          become properties of the window object, unlike var variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          An initializer for a constant is required. You must specify its value
          in the same statement in which it's declared. (This makes sense, given
          that it can't be changed later.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It
          does not mean the value it holds is immutableâ€”just that the variable
          identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, in the case where the
          content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its
          properties) can be altered.
